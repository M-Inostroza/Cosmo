# Cosmo

Cosmo is a small Unity project demonstrating simple orbital motion and a controllable rocket. The goal is to experiment with gravity and spaceship movement in a 2D scene.

## Controls
- **Move** &mdash; uses the `Player` action map from `InputSystem_Actions`
- **Left/Right Arrow** &mdash; rotate the rocket (desktop fallback)
- **Up Arrow** &mdash; apply forward thrust (desktop fallback)

## Opening the Project
1. Install **Unity 6000.0.47f1** or a compatible version.
2. In Unity Hub or the Unity Editor, choose **Open** and select the root folder of this repository.
3. Open `SampleScene` from the `Scenes` folder and press Play to start.
4. Ensure the **Rocket** object has a `PlayerInput` component using `InputSystem_Actions`.

Enjoy exploring orbital mechanics!
